## Version History

- **v1.0.0**: Initial release extracted from PeekabooCore with Swift 6 compliance
- **v0.x.x**: Development versions (internal)

## Migration Notes

### From PeekabooCore
When migrating from PeekabooCore's AI system:

1. **Error Types**: Replace `PeekabooError` with `TachikomaError`
2. **Import Statements**: Update to `import Tachikoma`
3. **Model Creation**: Use `Tachikoma.shared.getModel()` instead of direct instantiation
4. **Streaming Events**: Update event handling for new event type hierarchy
5. **Message Types**: Adopt new unified message type system
6. **Tool Calling**: Update to generic tool system with context support

### Breaking Changes
This is the initial release, so no breaking changes from previous versions.
